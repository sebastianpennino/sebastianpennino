### ✨ About me  
> Hi 👋 , I'm a Software Developer from 🇦🇷 that 💚 loves to code **meaningful interfaces** 🖥
>
> I like to work on interdisciplinary teams where I can **grow 🌱 as a developer** but also as an individual 
>
> I like to work close to the product. I believe some degree of messiness is necesary to achieve a good feature but I also think that _too much bureaucracy kills productivity_
>
> I prefer pragmatism instead of over-engineering, spaces over tabs and self-managment over micro-managment
>
> I also have a passion for 🎲🃏 board games and 👾 retro games, and really enjoy [bad puns][99] and [dad-jokes][1]


### 🔭 Check out some of my projects:
  -  [Root Board Game Helper][2] a PWA that helps players start a game of [Root][3]
  - [Ti4 Vanilla Game Draft][4] a SSR fullstack Web App for setting up the starting conditions for a game of [Twilight Imperium 4th Edition][5] (it's a poor's man [Milty Draft][6] for the Vanilla game).

### 🪦 Some unfinished projects:
  - (2016) 👾 [KageCloneJs][7] a [PhaserJS v2][8] game clone of a [NES][9] game I used to play called [Shadow of the Ninja / Kage][10]
  - (2021) 👾 [BubbleGumGirl][11] a pixel-art 2D Platformer made with [Godot Engine][12] that I plan on finishing some day

### 🧩 I’m currently working on:
  - A super small app to generate predictable pseudorandom gibberish-esque string of characters
  - A medium sized web app to track different states of the [OATH boardgame][13]
  - A CLI tool that will help me setup a web project based on my usual preferences (this is shelved for last)
